# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Paith Notes.

This project is currently in early pre-alpha.
The core architecture, data model, and workflows are still evolving.

---

## At this stage:

- Feature pull requests are unlikely to be accepted
- Large refactors or extensions will probably be rejected
- The API and internal structure are not stable

This is intentional.

### What is useful right now

During this phase, the most helpful contributions are:

- Design discussion
- Architectural feedback
- Pointing out flawed assumptions
- Identifying edge cases or long-term risks
- Reviewing documentation and philosophy

If you have thoughts along those lines, feel free to:

- open an issue
- start a discussion
- ask clarifying questions

Thoughtful critique is more valuable than code right now.

### Pull Requests

Please do not submit pull requests unless:

- they fix a clear bug
- they improve documentation
- they are explicitly discussed beforehand

Unsolicited feature PRs will likely be closed without merging — not because they’re bad, but because the project is not ready to accept them yet.

This avoids wasted effort on both sides.

### Licensing Note

Paith Notes uses a dual-licensing model.

Any future code contributions must be compatible with this model.
Details will be documented once the project reaches a more stable phase.

## Later Phases

Once Paith Notes reaches an alpha or beta stage, this document will be updated with:

- clearer contribution guidelines
- coding standards
- review process
- contribution and licensing terms

Until then, discussion > code.

Thanks for understanding — and for respecting the project’s current stage.
