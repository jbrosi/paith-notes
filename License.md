# License

Paith Notes is released under a dual-licensing model.

You may choose one of the following options.

## Option 1: Open Source License (AGPLv3)

Paith Notes is available as free and open source software under the
GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 (AGPLv3).

This means:

You may use, study, modify, and self-host the software freely.

If you modify the software and make it available to users over a network,
you must make the corresponding source code available to those users.

This applies to SaaS and hosted deployments as well.

The full license text is included in this repository:

LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.txt


## Option 2: Commercial License

If you want to use Paith Notes without the obligations of the AGPLv3,
a commercial license may be available.

This is typically relevant if you want to:

- offer Paith Notes as part of a proprietary SaaS
- embed it in a commercial product
- modify it without publishing your changes
- use it in an environment where AGPL is not acceptable

Commercial licensing does not affect individual users or self-hosters using the AGPL version.

For commercial licensing inquiries, contact:

sales@paith.me

(Details will be published once applicable.)

## No License Bait-and-Switch

Paith Notes will not retroactively change the license of existing versions.

Code released under AGPLv3 will remain AGPLv3.

The dual-licensing model is stated explicitly from the beginning.

## Contributions

Contributions must be compatible with the project’s licensing model.

This may require:

- agreement to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), or
- explicit confirmation that contributions can be re-licensed under both AGPLv3 and a commercial license.

Details will be documented before accepting significant code contributions.

## Summary (Non-Legal)

In plain terms:

- Individuals and self-hosters can use Paith Notes freely under AGPLv3.
- Organizations that want to build proprietary services on top of it should obtain a commercial license.

The project aims to remain honest, open, and portable — not extractive.
